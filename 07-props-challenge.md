## Challenge Time!

Let's have some practice creating a React component from scratch. How about a blog post?

1. Change directories back into the main directory where you want to keep your code (outside the `hello_world` React app directory we've been working on).

2. Referring to everything we've done up until now, create a new project using `create-react-app`. If you need to refresh your memory, refer to the Initial Setup section or view the official [`create-react-app` Github repository](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

  <blockquote>Note: Because `create-react-app` runs on port 3000, you'll have to stop the current `hello_world` app in order to view this new app (generally, hit ctrl + c in the Terminal window in which it's running).</blockquote>

3. In `src/App.jsx`, change the `App` component to be a `Post` component.

> Note: Normally, it would be good practice to rename the `App.jsx` file `Post.jsx` or to create a new component file for the `Post` component entirely. Then it would be obvious which component each file contains. However, don't do this! This is a comment for you to know best practices for the future - in this tutorial, leave the file named `App.jsx`. We're just concentrating on making it work for now!

4. Create a `post` object in `src/index.jsx` that has the following properties:
    - `title`  (example value: `"Dinosaurs are awesome"`)
    - `author` (example value: `"Stealthy Stegosaurus"`)
    - `body` (example value: `"Check out this body property!"`)
    - `comments` (example value: `["First!", "Great post", "Hire this author now!"]`)

5. Render a `Post` component with the information from your `post` object as its props values. For now, only include one of the comments. You decide how you want to display the title, author, body, and comment, or you can use the screenshot in the Solution section below as inspiration.  

6. Optional: adjust the CSS of your index file body to align your text to the center of the document.

## Solution

Here's what the solution might look like:

## Going forward
This blog project is going to continue through the next few days. When there are significant new topics, you'll add it to this blog! By the time you're done with React, you'll have a website with multiple pages; it will have user functionality like editing the blog post and entering their zip code to see their local weather.
